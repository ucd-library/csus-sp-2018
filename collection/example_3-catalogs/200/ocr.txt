   The Pyrenees, which form the boundary betwee n France and Spain , extend about 250 miles
   from the Atlant ic to the M edit erranean. The mountain s are remin iscent of the A lps in pro-
   file and formation, but on a smaller sca le, and they have, perhaps , a friend lie r and more
   intimate atmosphere. M any Pari sia ns now find it quite as easy, pleasanter, and less costly
   to trav el by train sout h-west to the Basque country and avo id the high populat ion concen-
   trat ion of the Alps .

   The food is quite fabulous her e, with wonderful Basque spec ialtie s, and the non -s kier will
   find it pleasant indeed to sit on the terrace of his hotel and look out over the deep valleys
   towards distant Spain .

   The towns to look for are Superbagneres at 6,000 ft. altitude , with its large , luxuriou s hotel ;
   Font-Romeu, pleasant ly situated on a high plateau and known for its sun shine and mildne ss
   of climat e; Bareges, well-known spa which was the sce ne of the French national downhill

   royalty, mov ie star s, renowned artists , millionaire s and int ernat iona l soc iety. There are
   now 43 hotel s, " four pa lace hotel s," the grea test being T he Pa lace. The town itself ne stles
   at an altitude above 6000 ft., and six languages are spoke n.
   The rea l life of St. Moritz starts at about 5 P.M. with the first aper itif and end s we ll after
   mid night amidst the pleasa nt clinking of Champagne glasses. We list below some extraord i-

   In general , the lar ger western ski resorts are much higher than their eastern counterparts
   and are more Alpine in character. There is a continuou s flow of airpl anes to Denver (for

   Baseball has caught on in Japan -a nd now skiing! Its popularity has increased by leaps
   and bound s, and now there are estimated to be over four million skiers in this small country ,
   with over 200 ski areas. Most of these centers feature bot springs, where bathing can be
   enjoyed. Th e most popular resorts are Shiga (4,900 ft.) and Akakura, where the big attrac-
   tion is natural hot spring baths (the chair lift cost is only 67Â¢ per day).
   In this far away country, the visual senses as well as the palate will be intrigued. There are
   wild vegetab les, wild game, roe of sea urchins , abalone, raw fish, baby octopus, sukiyaki
   and some of the best beef produced anywhere in the world. And, of course, there is the
   omnipresent sake ($2.75 the bottle at Sherry 's).
