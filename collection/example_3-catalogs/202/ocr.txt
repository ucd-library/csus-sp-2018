 AS WE GO TO PRESS
 We quote the headline from page one of the New York Times:

  "FRANCE IMPOSES TRADE CONTROLS; UNITED STATES TO RETALIATE"

 "WASHINGTON, June 26 - The United States reacted swiftly today to new French moves to subsidize
 exports by announcing that special duties would be imposed on goods from France."

 "PARIS, June 26 - The French Government moved today to limit price increases, subsidize exports and
 curb imports in order to counteract the economic damage of the recent general strike .•. An apparently
 strong Cabinet warning on price increases indicated that the Government would accept without question
 rises of up to 3 per cent, but woul d ·examine case by case any increase larger than that •.• However,
 there have been reports of far lar_ger increases here and there , For example, two leading publishers have
 just raised prices of paperback books by up to 20 per cent ... It conceded that in some marginal industries
 based on cheap labor, prices mig ht have to rise more , and it invited trade groups to negotiate voluntary
 price codes with the Government ••• Mr. Couve de Murville confirmed that France had sold gold lately,
 not only to Switzerland, as w.:is reported yesterday in Zurich, but also to West Germany and Italy.

 From where we sit as wine merchants, the above quotations indicate quite clearly that the FOB prices for
 European wines will not go down, but surely will rise - the extent still undetermined - between now and
 the end of the year. Obviously, this is quite inevitable based on increased costs for labor, bottles, corks,
 cases , transportation, etc.

  "FRENCH WINE ON AMERICAN DINNER TABLES MAY S~ON COST MORE"
  Proclaimed a headline in the New York Times of Saturday, June 22nd
 There is also a New York Times report dated 'Bordeaux, June 21st', continued - "The prices of a number
 of French wines exporte d to dealers in the United States are ex pected here to rise by between 5 aod 15
 per cent in the next several months as a result of the present round of wage increases in France ••• the larger
 w-i~e ~~p orting companies here are expected to avoid raising prices, by reducing profit margins if necessary,
 but many smaller concerns, which make up the ma [ority of the 760 wine-dealin g com pan ies in B0rdea11x
 will have to raise prices, merge with competitors or go out of business ••• "it is because of the increases
 in wages and other costs," said Gabriel Delaunay, the wine-loving prefect, or local Government repre-
 sentative, of La Gironde, the department of which this handsome seaport is the capital ••• interviewed
 in his gilded office, Mr, Delaunay said he believed that price increases on exported wine would be
 limited - they _will not be as much as 20 to 30 per cent."

 And we end on a somewhat pleasanter note by stating that there are only so m~ny Ch gg al Is or MooE;ts - and
 similarly, there are only so many cases of Choteau Haut Brion or Chambertin. In the present world ~arket,
 the demand for 'limited works of art' and 'limited wines of greatness' is greatly in excess of supply and this
 is inevitably reflected in the price, But we happily report, few of those who have acquired either great
 art or great wine have ever regretted it,

 A REPORT ON THE 1966 VINTAGE IN BORDEAUX

 1956 is the most noteworthy _vintage to date to succeed the great '61s. 1966 is truly great and in the
 classic frad 1t1on; we ll - balance d; sufficient tannin to indicate longevity; an ample supply of fruit - all
 the characteristics of a great year. If one were to compare 1966 to previous vi'ntages, it resembles most
 closely the 1953s. Frank Schoonmaker states, "all the '66s exhibit unusual bouquet, distinction, and
 class and some may well prove extraordinary. Highly recommended," Our confidential advice for laying
 down - for example, don't buy Choteau Haut Brion 1961 (and similarly, the other first growths) at $145.80
 the case, but buy the 1966 at $89.50 the case. Both '61 and '66 should reach their apex in drinking
 pleasu.-e, based on their maturation time table, at about the same time.

 THE 1966 VINTAGE IN BURGUNDY

 We must remember that the recent good years such as '61, '62, and '64 in red Burgundy no longer
 exist in the cellars of the growers . Most of them have sold off their bad '65s and are now trying to
 dispose of their pathetic '67s wh ich, by and large, were ruined by the September rains. The only
 great Burgundies that remain in their cellars are the glorious 1966s and because this is the only
 excellent wine they have to offer . The price at the vineyard therefore must be obviously very
 costly - the highest in history .

 Frank Schoonmaker puts the 1966 Burgundies just below the great 1961 level in his forthcoming
 vintage chart where he states, "a wholly remarkable year. From the very beginning, the wines
 had a special character and charm, an early sprightliness and fragrance and fruit which set them
 apart." Their develop _ment ~as ~urpassed our highest expectations and are definitely headed for
 great things. They would all be bottled and shipped by September or October 1968, and the
 lighter ones, ready to drink 6 months or a year later - even those should have a Iife expectancy
 of 7 or 8 years. Perfect wines for the early 1970s.

  RED WINES FROM NORTHERN CALIFORNIA FOR LAYING DOWN

 age to the wine. This is particularly true of the 'Cabernet Sauvignon' grape (the grape that produces the
 great clarets in Bordeaux) because the Cabernet grape takes longer to reach maturity when grown in California
 soil than in the Bordeaux area. The growth in quality and in price is typical of many of the better vineyards
 of California and we list them below, limiting ourselves to the best red wine they are capable of producing -
 the Cabernet Sauvignon. We urge that you try the experiment of buying them now, laying them away and
 serving proudly glorious fine wine from our native soil.
     NOW
 No. 'Case
 891* CABERNET SAUVIGNON Charles Krug ••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••• 26,24
 Exceptional vineyard founded by Robert and Peter Mondovi. Will thrive with bottle age.
 919* CABERNET SAUVIGNON, Louis Martini ••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••• 25.38
 Our 81 year old friend, Louis Martini, has long been dean of the wine growers of the
 Napa Valley. Beautifully balanced. Will thrive with further age.
 985 CABERNET SAUVIGNON, Samuele Sebastiani. ••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••• 24.30
 Grown in Sonoma Valley for over a half century by the beloved Sebastiani family. A
 favorite among Californians.
 902* CABERNET SAUVIGNON, Almaden Vineyards •••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••• 24.75
 Grown in choice land south of San Francisco in San Benito country under the wise guidance
 of Professor Winkler, former head of the Vinicultural Department of the University of
 California. No date appears on the label but it is actually of the 1966 vintage,
 912* CABERNET SAUVIGNON 1966, Beaulieu Vineyard •••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••• 25.35
 Highly rationed. Only a few cases will reach us in November. Order them now to make
 certain you get your share. Will soon command over $40.00. Especially fine.
 833 CABERNET SAUVIGNON, Robert Mondovi ••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••• 36.50
 We salute! We have just returned from Napa, California and we were amazed by what
 we tasted here. In our opinion, the best red wine ever produced in America and in the
 league with the well-known clarets of Bordeaux. However, it still requires more barrel
 ~e and the wine will not reach us until April 1969. Since the total production is so
 tiny, we strongly suggest you acquire it now and lay it away for a year or two.
