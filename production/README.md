# Production DAMS

This is an example of what a more production environment might look like.
This is quite similar to the example setup in the parent directory, with some
important modifications.

- We've elimintated any local users.  In our case, we use the UCD Kerberos service to generate our tokens.
- We no longer store the environment files in our public reposistory.
